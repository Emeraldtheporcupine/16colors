# ![Logo](./public/16-Colors-Logo@3x.png) ColorByPixel

Also goes by "16 Colors"

This is a simple project I did on the side to explore the following:

1. Svelte
2. Github Actions
3. File handling on client side
4. Domain names and DNS (still hate it)

I wouldn't use this repo as an example of what's best with Svelte or even file handling, but it may help you learn these tools/patterns by being reasonably easy to read. 

## Contributions

I'm always looking to add more palettes based on real-life marker sets.  Feel free to open a PR with a new palette and a link to the marker set that goes with it.
